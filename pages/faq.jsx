        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>
          If you're behind on your mortgage or facing foreclosure in Arizona, you're probably searching for fast answers from someone you can trust. We specialize in helping Maricopa County homeowners in pre-foreclosure explore every option — without pressure or fees.

        <h2>1. What are my options if I’m behind on mortgage payments?</h2>
        <p>
          You typically have three main options:
          apply for a loan modification, sell your home (for cash or on the open market), or do nothing — which usually leads to foreclosure. We help you evaluate all three.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Can I sell my home in foreclosure?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes — even after receiving a Notice of Trustee Sale. We specialize in urgent timelines and protecting remaining equity.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Can you help me keep my home?</h2>
        <p>
          Absolutely. If staying is your goal, we’ll help you apply for a loan modification at no cost.
        </p>

        <h2>4. How do I stop a foreclosure auction in Phoenix?</h2>
        <p>
          You can file a loan modification, initiate a sale, or explore bankruptcy (we don’t provide legal advice but explain timing). Acting early is critical.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Will I have to move out right away if I sell?</h2>
        <p>
          No. We often arrange post-sale occupancy so you have time to transition on your own terms.
        </p>

        <h2>6. How fast can I get a cash offer?</h2>
        <p>
          Usually within 24 hours. Closings can happen in as little as 7 days, depending on title and condition.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Do you charge any fees up front?</h2>
        <p>
          Never. No consultation fees, loan mod help charges, or upfront costs for offers.
        </p>

        <h2>8. What happens to my credit if I get foreclosed on?</h2>
        <p>
          Foreclosure can impact your credit for up to 7 years. Selling or modifying can reduce the damage.
        </p>

        <h2>9. What if I owe more than my home is worth?</h2>
        <p>
          We help with short sales — where your lender agrees to accept less than you owe. It protects your credit and lets you move on without the full debt.
        </p>

        <h2>10. I’ve received a Notice of Trustee Sale — is it too late?</h2>
        <p>
          Not necessarily. We've helped homeowners just days before auction. Time is critical, so contact us immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>11. What if I have a tax lien, HOA debt, or code violations?</h2>
        <p>
          We resolve complex title issues like these as part of the sales process — you don’t have to figure it out alone.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Can I list my home instead of selling directly?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes. We're a licensed brokerage. If listing will net you more, we’ll guide you through that process.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Do I need good credit to work with you?</h2>
        <p>
          No. We work with homeowners in all financial situations — including those with bad credit or bankruptcy.
        </p>

        <h2>14. What happens if I do nothing?</h2>
        <p>
          Your home may go to auction. You’ll lose control, your credit will be damaged, and you’ll likely forfeit any remaining equity.
        </p>

        <h2>15. How do I get started?</h2>
        <p>
