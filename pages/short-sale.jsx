        <h2>What Is a Short Sale?</h2>
        <p>
          A short sale is when your lender agrees to let you sell your home for less than what you owe. 
          It’s a legal, negotiated process that requires a hardship explanation, a buyer offer, and lender approval.
        </p>
        <p>We handle the entire process — and you pay nothing out of pocket.</p>
