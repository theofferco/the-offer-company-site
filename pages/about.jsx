        <h2>Why We Use AI</h2>
        <p>
          Most homeowners facing foreclosure need fast answers — and waiting for callbacks or emails just adds stress. That’s why we created <strong>Hope</strong>, our 24/7 AI assistant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hope can explain your options, walk you through next steps, and even schedule an in-person consultation — all in plain English, whenever you're ready.
