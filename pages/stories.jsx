            <blockquote>
              “I had a foreclosure date coming up fast. I thought my only option was to sell and leave, but they actually helped me apply for a loan modification and keep my home. And they didn’t charge a dime.”
            </blockquote>

          <li>
            <blockquote>
              “I had three liens on the house and no savings. They gave me a cash offer that included settling the debts and letting me stay in the property for two more months while I found my next place.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>— Robert T., Avondale</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <blockquote>
              “They offered to buy, list, or even help me stay. No pressure — just walked me through every option. I chose to sell, and they handled everything. It was fast, respectful, and fair.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>— Maria D., Mesa</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <blockquote>
              “I got more than I expected from the sale and avoided foreclosure entirely. I didn’t feel like I was being sold — I felt like I was being helped.”
            </blockquote>

          </li>

          <li>
            <blockquote>
              “I was scared and behind on payments. Hope, the AI assistant, answered my questions right away. Then I met with the team and found out I had more options than I realized.”

            <p>— Brian L., Chandler</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <blockquote>
              “I didn’t want to deal with showings or agent fees. They gave me a real offer, explained everything clearly, and let me close on my terms.”
